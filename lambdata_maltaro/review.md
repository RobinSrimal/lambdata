Robin's code is written very well. I can understand the logic what he was doing.
He did 2helper functions.
In first definition he add list as new column to original dataframe which was
pretty undestandable.

In second definition he used numpy library to count how many zeros are in the array.

Code is very clear, logic and understandable.

Style and design is also very nice and organized, he used comments to explain
what is he doing to understand the code.    

I noticed that Code was also checked with autopep8, which is also big plus.




His code meet requirements  -  3 (but maybe you could do  more helper functions)
